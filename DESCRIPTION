Description: This package contributes to the euclidean distance matrix analysis. It assists at the 
    data preparation and at the display of the results. From an initial matrix with all landmarks
    coordinates for the studied individuals, it calculates a new matrix based on the euclidean 
    distance matrix for all possible pairwise landmarks distances that will be used for further 
    analysis performed on standard basis. Then, the package assists in the representation of the
    landmarks for the mean values of defined groups, enabling comparisson among groups.
